Keep far from us crooked evil, and we shall offer thee the fullest praise! (Rv. I, 189, 1.) This Upanishad, though apparently simple and intelligible, is in reality one of the most difficult to understand properly. Coming at the end of the Vâ g asaneyi-sa m hitâ, in which the sacrifices and the hymns to be used by the officiating priests have been described, it begins by declaring that all has to be surrendered to the Lord. The name îs, lord, is peculiar, as having a far more personal colouring than Âtman, Self, or Brahman, the usual names given by the Upanishads to what is the object of the highest knowledge. Next follows a permission to continue the performance of sacrifices, provided that all desires have been surrendered. And here occurs our first difficulty, which has perplexed ancient as well as modern commentators. I shall try, first of all, to justify my own translation. I hold that the Upanishad wishes to teach the uselessness by themselves of all good works, whether we call them sacrificial, legal, or moral, and yet, at the same time, to recognise, if not the necessity, at least the harmlessness of good works, provided they are performed without any selfish motives, without any desire of reward, but simply as a preparation for higher knowledge, as a means, in fact, of subduing all passions, and producing that serenity of mind without which man is incapable of receiving the highest knowledge. From that point of view the Upanishad may well say, Let a man wish to live here his appointed time, let him even perform all works. If only he knows that all must be surrendered to the Lord, then the work done by him will not cling to him. It will not work on and produce effect after effect, nor will it involve him in a succession of new births in which to enjoy the reward of his works, but it will leave him free to enjoy the blessings of the highest knowledge. It will have served as a preparation for that higher knowledge which the Upanishad imparts, and which secures freedom from further births. The expression 'na karma lipyate nare' seems to me to admit of this one explanation only, viz. that work done does not cling to man, provided he has acquired the highest knowledge. Similar expressions occur again and again. Lip was, no doubt, used originally of evil deeds which became, as it were, engrained in man; but afterwards of all work, even of good work, if done with a desire of reward. The doctrine of the Upanishads is throughout that orthodoxy and sacrifice can procure a limited beatitude only, and that they are a hindrance to real salvation, which can be obtained by knowledge alone. In our passage therefore we can recognise one meaning only, viz. that work does not cling to man or stain him, if only he knows, i.e. if he has been enlightened by the Upanishad. S ankara, in his commentary on the Vedânta-sûtras III, 4, 7; 13; 14, takes the same view of this passage. The opponent of Bâdarâya n a, in this case, G aimini himself, maintains that karma, work, is indispensable to knowledge, and among other arguments, he says, III, 4, 7, that it is so 'Niyamât,' 'Because it is so laid down by the law.' The passage here referred to is, according to S Sankara, our very verse, which, he thinks, should be translated as follows: 'Let a man wish to live a hundred years here (in this body) performing works; thus will an evil deed not cling to thee, while thou art a man; there is no other way but this by which to escape the influence of works. In answer to this, Bâdarâya n a says, first of all, III, 4, 13, that this rule may refer to all men in general, and not to one who knows; or, III, 4, 14, if it refers to a man who knows, that then the permission to perform works is only intended to exalt the value of knowledge, the meaning being that even to a man who performs sacrifices all his life, work does not cling, if only he knows;—such being the power of knowledge. The same S ankara, however, who here sees quite clearly that this verse refers to a man who knows, explains it in the Upanishad as referring to a man who does not know (itarasyânâtma g ñatayâtmagraha n â s aktasya). It would then mean: 'Let such a one, while performing works here on earth, wish to live a hundred years. In this manner there is no other way for him but this (the performance of sacrifices), so that an evil deed should not be engrained, or so that he should hot be stained by such a deed.' The first and second verses of the Upanishad would thus represent the two paths of life, that of knowledge and that of works, and the following verses would explain the rewards assigned to each. Mahîdhara, in his commentary on the Vâ g asaneyi-sa m hitâ, steers at first a middle course. He would translate: 'Let one who performs the Agnihotra and other sacrifices, without any desire of reward, wish to live here a hundred years. If thou do so, there will be salvation for thee, not otherwise. There are many roads that lead to heaven, but one only leading to salvation, namely, performance of good works, without any desire of reward, which produces a pure heart. Work thus done, merely as a preparation for salvation, does not cling to man, i.e. it produces a pure heart, but does not entail any further consequences.' So far he agrees with Uva t a's explanation [ 13 ] . He allows, however, another explanation also, so that the second line would convey the meaning: 'If a man lives thus (performing good works), then there is no other way by which an evil deed should not be engrained; i.e. in order to escape the power of sin, he must all his life perform sacred acts.' Next follows a description of the lot of those who, immersed in works, have not arrived at the highest knowledge, and have not recovered their true self in the Highest Self, or Brahman. That Brahman, though the name is not used here, is then described, and salvation is promised to the man who beholds all things in the Self and the Self in all things. The verses 9-14 are again full of difficulty, not so much in themselves as in their relation to the general system of thought which prevails in the Upanishads, and forms the foundation of the Vedânta philosophy. The commentators vary considerably in their interpretations. S ankara explains avidyâ, not-knowledge, by good works, particularly sacrifice, performed with a hope of reward; vidyâ, or knowledge, by a knowledge of the gods, but not, as yet, of the highest Brahman. The former is generally supposed to lead the sacrificer to the pit ri loka, the world of the fathers, from whence he returns to a series of new births; the latter to the devaloka, the world of the gods, from whence he may either proceed to Brahman, or enter upon a new round of existences. The question then arises, how in our passage the former could be said to lead to blind darkness, the latter to still greater darkness. But for that statement, I have no doubt that all the commentators would, as usual, have taken vidyâ for the knowledge of the Highest Brahman, and avidyâ for orthodox belief in the gods and good works, the former securing immortality in the sense of freedom from new births, while the reward of the latter is blessedness in heaven for a limited period, but without freedom from new births. This antithesis between vidyâ and avidyâ seems to me so firmly established that I cannot bring myself to surrender it here. Though this Upanishad has its own very peculiar character, yet its object is, after all, to impart a knowledge of the Highest Self, and not to inculcate merely a difference between faith in the ordinary gods and good works. It was distinctly said before (ver. 3), that those who have destroyed their self, i.e. who perform works only, and have not arrived at a knowledge of the true Self, go to the worlds of the Asuras, which are covered with blind darkness. If then the same blind darkness is said in verse 9 to be the lot of those who worship not-knowledge, this can only mean those who have not discovered the true Self, but are satisfied with the performance of good works. And if those who perform good works are opposed to others who delight in true knowledge, that knowledge can be the knowledge of the true Self only. The difficulty therefore which has perplexed S ankara is this, how, while the orthodox believer is said to enter into blind darkness, the true disciple, who has acquired a knowledge of the true Self, could be said to enter into still greater darkness. While S ankara in this case seems hardly to have caught the drift of the Upanishad, Uva t a and Mahîdhara propose an explanation which is far more satisfactory. They perceive that the chief stress must be laid on the words ubhaya m saha, \"both together\" in verses 11 and 14. The doctrine of certain Vedânta philosophers was that works, though they cannot by themselves lead to salvation, are useful as a preparation for the highest knowledge, and that those who imagine that they can attain the highest knowledge without such previous preparation, are utterly mistaken. From this point of view therefore the author of the Upanishad might well say that those who give themselves to what is not knowledge, i.e. to sacrificial and other good works, enter into darkness, but that those who delight altogether in knowledge, despising the previous discipline of works, deceive themselves and enter into still greater darkness. Then follows the next verse, simply stating that, according to the teaching of wise people, the reward of knowledge is one thing, the reward of ignorance, i.e. trust in sacrifice, another. Here Mahîdhara is right again by assigning the pit ri loka, the world of the fathers, as the reward of the ignorant; the devaloka, the world of the gods, as the reward of the enlightened, provided that from the world of the gods they pass on to the knowledge of the Highest Self or Brahman. The third verse contains the strongest confirmation of Mahîdhara's view. Here it is laid down distinctly that he only who knows both togethe r, both what is called ignorance and what is called knowledge, can be saved, because by good works he overcomes death, here explained by natural works, and by knowledge he obtains the Immortal, here explained by oneness with the gods, the last step that leads on to oneness with Brahman. Uva t a, who takes the same view of these verses, explains at once, and even more boldly than Mahîdhara [ 14 ] , vidyâ, or knowledge, by brahmavi g ñâna, knowledge of Brahman, which by itself, and if not preceded by works, leads to even greater darkness than what is called ignorance, i.e. sacrifice and orthodoxy without knowledge. The three corresponding verses, treating of sambhûti and asambhûti instead of vidyâ and avidyâ, stand first in the Vâ g asaneyisa m thitâ. They must necessarily be explained in accordance with our explanation of the former verses, i.e. sambhûti must correspond to vidyâ, it must be meant for the true cause, i.e. for Brahman, while asambhûti must correspond with avidyâ, as a name of what is not real, but phenomenal only and perishable. Mahidhara thinks that these verses refer to the Bauddhas, which can hardly be admitted, unless we take Buddhist in a very general sense. Uva t a puts the Lokâyatas in their place [ 15 ] . It is curious also to observe that Mahîdhara, following Uva t a, explains asambhûti at first by the denial of the resurrection of the body, while he takes sambhûti rightly for Brahman. I have chiefly followed Uva t a's commentary, except in his first explanation of asambhûti, resurrection [ 16 ] . In what follows Uva t a explains sambhûti rightly by the only cause of the origin of the whole world, i.e. Brahman [ 17 ] , while he takes vinâ s a, destruction, as a name of the perishable body [ 18 ] . S ankara sees much more in these three verses than Uva t a. He takes asambhûti as a name of Prak ri ti, the undeveloped cause, sambhûti as a name of the phenomenal Brahman or Hira ny agarbha. From a worship of the latter a man obtains supernatural powers, from devotion to the former, absorption in Prak ri ti. Mahîdhara also takes a similar view, and he allows, like S ankara, another reading, viz. sambhûtim avinâ s a m k a, and avinâ s ena m ri tyu m tîrtvâ. In this case the sense would be: 'He who knows the worship both of the developed and the undeveloped, overcomes death, i.e. such evil as sin, passion, &c, through worship of the undeveloped, while he obtains through worship of the developed, i.e. of Hira n yagarbha, immortality, absorption in Prakr ri ti.' All these forced explanations to which the commentators have recourse, arise from the shifting views held by various authorities with regard to the value of works. Our Upanishad seems to me to propound the doctrine that works, though in themselves useless, or even mischievous, if performed with a view to any present or future rewards, are necessary as a preparatory discipline. This is or was for a long time the orthodox view. Each man was required to pass through the âsramas, or stages of student and householder, before he was admitted to the freedom of a Sannyâsin. As on a ladder, no step was to be skipped. Those who attempted to do so, were considered to have broken the old law, and in some respects they may indeed be looked upon as the true precursors of the Buddhists. Nevertheless the opposite doctrine, that a man whose mind had become enlightened, might at once drop the fetters of the law, without performing all the tedious duties of student and householder, had strong supporters too among orthodox philosophers. Cases of such rapid conversion occur in the ancient traditions, and Bâdarâya n a himself was obliged to admit the possibility of freedom and salvation without works, though maintaining the superiority of the usual course, which led on gradually from works to enlightenment and salvation [ 19 ] . It was from an unwillingness to assent to the decided teaching of the Îsâ-upanishad that S ankara attempted to explain vidyâ, knowledge, in a limited sense, as knowledge of the gods, and not yet knowledge of Brahman. He would not admit that knowledge without works could lead to darkness, and even to greater darkness than works without knowledge. Our Upanishad seems to have dreaded libertinism, knowledge without works, more even than ritualism, works without knowledge, and its true object was to show that orthodoxy and sacrifice, though useless in themselves, must always form the preparation for higher enlightenment. How misleading S ankara's explanation may prove, we can see from the translation of this Upanishad by Rammohun Roy. He followed S ankara implicitly, and this is the sense which he drew from the text:— '9. Those observers of religious rites that perform only the worship of the sacred fire, and oblations to sages, to ancestors, to men, and to other creatures, without regarding the worship of celestial gods, shall enter into the dark region: and those practisers of religious ceremonies who habitually worship the celestial gods only, disregarding the worship of the sacred fire, and oblations to sages, to ancestors, to men, and to other creatures, shall enter into a region still darker than the former. '10. It is said that adoration of the celestial gods produces one consequence; and that the performance of the worship of sacred fire, and oblations to sages, to ancestors, to men, and to other creatures, produce another: thus have we heard from learned men, who have distinctly explained the subject to us. '11. Of those observers of ceremonies whosoever, knowing that adoration of celestial gods, as well as the worship of the sacred fire, and oblation to sages, to ancestors, to men, and to other creatures, should be observed alike by the same individual, performs them both, will, by means of the latter, surmount the obstacles presented by natural temptations, and will attain the state of the celestial gods through the practice of the former. '12. Those observers of religious rites who worship Prak ri ti alone (Prak ri ti or nature, who, though insensible, influenced by the Supreme Spirit, operates throughout the universe) shall enter into the dark region: and those practisers of religious ceremonies that are devoted to worship solely the prior operating sensitive particle, allegorically called Brahmá, shall enter into a region much more dark than the former. '13. It is said that one consequence may be attained by the worship of Brahmá, and another by the adoration of Prak ri ti. Thus have we heard from learned men, who have distincdy explained the subject to us. '14. Of those observers of ceremonies, whatever person, knowing that the adoration of Prak ri ti and that of Brahmd should be together observed by the same individual, performs them both, will by means of the latter overcome indigence, and will attain the state of Prak ri ti, through the practice of the former.' ↑ Asuryâ, Vâ g .

Footnotes ↑ This verse admits of various translations, and still more various explanations. Instead of taking vâ k am, like all the other words, as a nominative, we might take them all as accusatives, governed by atimu k ya, and sa u prâ n asya prâ n a h as a parenthetical sentence. What is meant by the ear is very fully explained by the commentator, but the simplest acceptation would seem to take it as an answer to the preceding questions, so that the ear of the ear should be taken for him who directs the ear, i.e. the Self, or Brahman. This will become clearer as we proceed. ↑ Cf. Î s a Up. 11; 13. ↑ The varia lectio manaso matam (supported also by the commentary) is metrically and grammatically easier, but it may be, for that very reason, an emendation. ↑ In order to obtain a verse, we must leave out the words tvam yad asya deveshv atha nu mîmâ m syam eva. They were probably inserted, as an excuse for the third kha nd a treating of the relation of Brahman to the Devas. There is considerable variety in the text, as handed down in the Sâma-veda and in the Atharva-veda, which shows that it has been tampered with. Daharam for dabhram may be the older reading, as synezesis occurs again and again in the Upanishads. ↑ This verse has again been variously explained. I think the train of thought is this: We cannot know Brahman, as we know other objects, by referring them to a class and pointing out their differences. But, on the other hand, we do not know that we know him not, i.e. no one can assert that we know him not, for we want Brahman in order to know anything. He, therefore, who knows this double peculiarity of the knowledge of Brahman, he knows Brahman, as much as it can be known; and he does not know, nor can anybody prove it to him, that he does not know Brahman. ↑ This kha nd a is generally represented as a later addition, but its prose style has more of a Brâhma n a character than the verses in the preceding kha nd as, although their metrical structure is irregular, and may be taken as a sign of antiquity. ↑ Umâ may here be taken as the wife of S iva, daughter of Himavat, better known by her earlier name, Pârvatî, the daughter of the mountains. Originally she was, not the daughter of the mountains or of the Himâlaya, but the daughter of the cloud, just as Rudra was originally, not the lord of the mountains, girî s a, but the lord of the clouds. We are, however, moving here in a secondary period of Indian thought, in which we see, as among Semitic nations, the manifested powers, and particularly the knowledge and wisdom of the gods, represented by their wives. Umâ means originally flax, from vâ, to weave, and the same word may have been an old name of wife, she who weaves (cf. duhit ri , spinster, and possibly wife itself, if O.H.G. wîb is connected with O.H.G. wëban). It is used almost synonymously with ambikâ, Taitt. Âr. p. 839. If we wished to take liberties, we might translate umâ haimavatâ by an old woman coming from the Himavat mountains; but I decline all responsibility for such an interpretation. ↑ The next phrase was borrowed from §3, without even changing the singular to the plural. As Indra only found out that it was Brahman, the original distinction between Indra and the other gods, who only came near to it, was quite justified. Still it might be better to adopt the var. lect. sa hy etat in §2. ↑ I have translated these paragraphs very differently from S aṅkara and other interpreters. The wording is extremely brief, and we can only guess the original intention of the Upanishad by a reference to other passages. Now the first teaching of Brahman, by means of a comparison with the gods or heavenly things in general, seems to be that Brahman is what shines forth suddenly like lightning. Sometimes the relation between the phenomenal world and Brahman is illustrated by the relation between bubbles and the sea, or lightning and the unseen heavenly light (Mait. Up. VI, 35). In another passage, Kh . Up. VIII, 12, 2, lightning, when no longer seen, is to facilitate the conception of the reality of things, as distinct from their perceptibility. I think, therefore, that the first simile, taken from the phenomenal world, was meant to show that Brahman is that which appears for a moment in the lightning, and then vanishes from our sight. The next illustration is purely psychological. Brahman is proved to exist, because our mind moves towards things, because there is something in us which moves and perceives, and because there is something in us which holds our perceptions together (saṅkalpa), and revives them again by memory. I give my translation as hypothetical only, for certainty is extremely difficult to attain, when we have to deal with these enigmatical sayings which, when they were first delivered, were necessarily accompanied by oral explanations. ↑ Tadvana, as a name of Brahman, is explained by 'the desire of it,' and derived from va n, to desire, the same as vâñ kh . ↑ It is impossible to adopt S aṅkara's first rendering, 'the Vedas and all the Aṅgas,' i.e. the six subsidiary doctrines. He sees himself that sarvâṅgâni stands in opposition to pratish th â and âyatana, but seeing Veda and Aṅga together, no Brahman could help thinking of the Vedâṅgas. ↑ Might we read a g yeye for g yeye? cf.

VI, 1, 1), is also called Âru n i (Uddâlaka, comm. Kaush. Up. I, 1) Gautama. S vetaketu himself is called Âru n eya, i. e. the son of Âru n i, the grandson of Aru n a, and likewise Auddâlaki. Auddâlaki is a son of Uddâlaka, but S ankara (Kâ th . Up. I, 11) takes Auddâlaki as possibly the same as Uddâlaka. See B ri h. Âr. Up. III, 6, 1. ↑ As to ănanda, unblessed, see B ri h. Âr. Up. IV, 4, 1 1 ; Vâ g as. Sa m h. Up. 3 (Sacred Books of the East, vol. i, p. 311). ↑ Ânandagiri explains that the cows meant here are cows no longer able to drink, to eat, to give milk, and to calve. ↑ Dadâmi, I give, with the meaning of the future. Some MSS. write dâsyâmi. ↑ I translate these verses freely, i.e. independently of the commentator, not that I ever despise the traditional interpretation which the commentators have preserved to us, but because I think that, after having examined it, we have a right to judge for ourselves. S ankara says that the son, having been addressed by his father full of anger, was sad, and said to himself: \"Among many pupils I am the first, among many middling pupils I am the middlemost, but nowhere am I the last. Yet though I am such a good pupil, my father has said that he will consign me unto death. What duty has he to fulfil toward Yama which he means to fulfil to-day by giving me to him? There may be no duty, he may only have spoken in haste. Yet a father's word must not be broken.\" Having considered this, the son comforted his father, and exhorted him to behave like his forefathers, and to keep his word. I do not think this view of S ankara's could have been the view of the old poet. He might have made the son say that he was the best or one of the best of his father's pupils, but hardly that he was also one of his middling pupils, thus implying that he never was among the worst. That would be out of keeping with the character of Na k iketas, as drawn by the poet himself. Na k iketas is full of faith and wishes to die, he would be the last to think of excuses why he should not die. The second half of the verse may be more doubtful. It may mean what S ankara thinks it means, only that we should get thus again an implied complaint of Na k iketas against his father, and this is not in keeping with his character. The mind of Na k iketas is bent on what is to come, on what he will see after death, and on what Yama will do unto him. \"What has Yama to do,\" he asks, \"what can he do, what is it that he will to-day do unto me?\" This seems to me consistent with the - ancient story, while S ankara's interpretations and interpolations savour too much of the middle ages of India. ↑ Sasya, corn rather than grass; -, -, Benfey; Welsh haidd, according to Rhys; different from s ash-pa, ces-pes, Benfey. ↑ Cf. Vasish th a XI, 13; Sacred Books of the East, vol. xiv, p. 51. ↑ Vaivasvata, a name of Yama, the ruler of the departed. Water is the first gift to be offered to a stranger who claims hospitality. ↑ Here again some words are translated differently from S ankara. He explains â s â as asking for a wished-for object, pratikshâ as looking forward with a view to obtaining an unknown object. Sangata he takes as reward for intercourse with good people; sûn ri tâ, as usual, as good and kind speech; ish t a as rewards for sacrifices; pûrta as rewards for public benefits. ↑ The commentator translates: \"I tell it thee, attend to me who knows the heavenly fire.\" Here the nom. sing. of the participle would be very irregular, as we can hardly refer it to bravîmi. Then \"Know this fire as a means of obtaining the heavenly world, know that fire as the rest or support of the world, when it assumes the form of Virâ g , and as hidden in the heart of men.\" ↑ S ankara: the first embodied, in the shape of Virâ g . ↑ Verses 16-18 seem a later addition. ↑ This arises probably from a misunderstanding of verse II, 3. ↑ G âtavedas. ↑ Tavaiva is a later addition, caused by the interpolation of verses 15-18. ↑ Mahâbhûmau, on the great earth, has been explained also by mahâ bhûmau, be great on the earth. It is doubtful, however, whether mahâ for mahân could be admitted in the Upanishads, and whether it would not be easier to write mahân bhûmau. ↑ A very obscure verse. S ankara gives a various reading kva tadâstha h for kvadha h stha h , in the sense of \"given to these pleasures,\" which looks like an emendation. I have changed a g îryatâm into a g âryatâm, and take it for an acc. sing., instead of a gen. plur., which could hardly be governed by upetya. ↑ Cf. I, 16. ↑ The commentator explains lolupanta h by vi kkh eda m k ri tavanta h . Some MSS. read lolupante and lolupanti, but one expects either lolupyante or lolupati. ↑ Cf. Mu nd . Up. II, 8. ↑ Cf. Bhag Gîtâ II, 29. ↑ Cf. Mu nd . Up, II, 4. ↑ I read a n upramâ n ât. Other interpretations: If it is taught by one who is identified with the Self, then there is no uncertainty. If it has been taught as identical with ourselves, then there is no perception of anything else. If it has been taught by one who is identified with it, then there is no failure in understanding it (agati). ↑ Âpaneyâ; should it be âpanâya, as afterwards su gñ ânâya? ↑ Because you insist on my teaching it to thee. ↑ Unless no is negative, for Yama, at first, does not like to communicate his knowledge. ↑ The words in parentheses have been added in order to remove the otherwise contradictory character of the two lines. ↑ Cf. Kh ând. Up. VII, 12, 2. ↑ Yama seems here to propound the lower Brahman only, not yet the highest. Deva, God, can only be that as what the Old, i.e. the Self in the heart, is to be recognised. It would therefore mean, he who finds God or the Self in his heart. See afterwards, verse 21. ↑ Cf. S vet. Up. IV, 9; Bhag. Gitâ VIII, 11. ↑ As to verses 18 and 19, see Bhag. Gîtâ II, 19, 20. ↑ Cf. S vet. Up. III, 20; Taitt. Âr. X, 12, 1. ↑ The commentator translates \"through the tranquillity of the senses\" i.e. dhâtuprasâdât, taking prasâda in the technical sense of samprasâda. As to kratu, desire, or rather, will, see B ri h. Âr. IV, 4, 5. ↑ Cf. Tal. Up. 5. ↑ Cf. I, 7-9; M un d. Up. III, 2, 3; Bhag. Gîtâ I, 53. ↑ In whom all disappears, and in whom even death is swallowed up. ↑ The two are explained as the higher and lower Brahman, the former being the light, the latter the shadow. Ri ta is explained as reward, and connected with suk ri ta, lit. good deeds, but frequently used in the sense of svak ri ta, one's own good and evil deeds. The difficulty is, how the highest Brahman can be said to drink the reward ( ri tapa) of former deeds, as it is above all works and above all rewards. The commentator explains it away as a metaphorical expression, as we often speak of many, when we mean one. (Cf. Mu nd . Up. III, 1, 1.) I have joined suk ri tasya with loke, loka meaning the world, i.e. the state, the environment, which we made to ourselves by our former deeds. ↑ These two verses may be later additions. ↑ The simile of the chariot has some points of similarity with the well-known passage in Plato's Phaedros, but Plato did not borrow this simile from the Brahmans, as little as Xenophon need have consulted our Upanishad (II, 2) in writing his prologue of Prodikos. ↑ S ankara interprets, he should keep down speech in the mind. ↑ Comm., excellent teachers. ↑ The first manifestation of Brahman, commonly called Hira n yagarbha, which springs from the tapas of Brahman. Afterwards only water and the rest of the elements become manifested. The text of these verses is abrupt, possibly corrupt. The two accusatives, tish th antam and tish th antîm, seem to me to require veda to be supplied from verse 4. ↑ Cf. s ri sh t ikrama. ↑ Cf. V, 8. ↑ S vet. Up.

Gîtâ XV, 1-3. ↑ Cf. V, 8. ↑ The commentator says that the tree is the world, and its root is Brahman, but there is nothing to support this view in the original, where tree, roots, and branches are taken together as representing the Brahman in its various manifestations. ↑ According to the commentator, in the highest Brahman. ↑ Cf. Taitt. Up. II, 8, 1. ↑ The commentator translates: \"If a man is able to understand (Brahman), then even before the decay of his body, he is liberated. If he is not able to understand it, then he has to take body again in the created worlds.\" I doubt whether it is possible to supply so much, and should prefer to read iha k en nâ s akad, though I find it difficult to explain how so simple a text should have been misunderstood and corrupted. ↑ Roer: \"As in a picture and in the sunshine.\" ↑ They arise from the elements, ether, &c. ↑ Buddhi or intellect, cf. III, 10. ↑ Much better in S vet. Up. IV, 20: \"Those who know him by the heart as being in the heart, and by the mind, are immortal.\" ↑ S ankara explains apyaya by apâya. ↑ Ignorance, passion, &c. Cf. Mu nd . Up. II, 1, 10; II, 2, 9. ↑ The teaching of the Vedânta extends so far and no farther. (Cf. Pra s na Up. VI, 7.) What follows has reference, according to the commentator, not to him who knows the highest Brahman; for he becomes Brahman at once and migrates no more; but to him who does not know the highest Brahman fully, and therefore migrates to the Brahmaloka, receiving there the reward for his partial knowledge and for his good works. ↑ Cf. Kh ând. Up. VIII, 6, 6. ↑ It passes out by the head. ↑ The commentator says: He rises through the sun {Mu nd . Up. I, 2, 11) to a world in which he enjoys some kind of immortality. ↑ S vet. Up.

Comm. ↑ Satya, if we compare Ka th . VI, 7 and III, 10, seems to mean buddhi. Here it is explained by the five elements. ↑ Hira n yagarbha. Comm. ↑ Nâmarûpam, a very frequent concept in Buddhistic literature. ↑ In the beginning of the second Kha nd a the lower knowledge is first described, referring to the performance of sacrifices and other good deeds. The reward of them is perishable, and therefore a desire is awakened after the higher knowledge. ↑ The Tretâ age is frequently mentioned as the age of sacrifices. I should prefer, however, to take tretâ in the sense of trayî vidyâ, and santata as developed, because the idea that the Tretâ age was distinguished by its sacrifices, seems to me of later origin. Even the theory of the four ages or yugas, though known in the Ait. Brâhma n a, is not frequently alluded to in the older Upanishads. See Weber, Ind. Stud. I, p. 283. ↑ The termination tha for ta looks suspiciously Buddhistic; see \"Sanskrit Texts discovered in Japan,\" J.R.A.S. 1880, p. 180. ↑ Svak ri ta and suk ri ta are constantly interchanged. They mean the same, good deeds, or deeds performed by oneself and believed to be good. ↑ At the Agnihotra, the first of all sacrifices, and the type of many others, two portions of â g ya are sacrificed on the right and left side of the Âhavanîya altar. The place between the two is called the Âvâpasthâna, and here the oblations to the gods are to be offered. There are two oblations in the morning to Sûrya and Pra g âpati, two in the evening to Agni and Pra g âpati. Other sacrifices, such as the Dar s a and Pûr n amâsa, and those mentioned in verse 3, are connected with the Agnihotra. ↑ The seven worlds form the rewards of a pious sacrificer, the first is Bhu h , the last Satya. The seven worlds may also be explained as the worlds of the father, grandfather, and great-grand-father, of the son, the grandson, and great-grandson, and of the sacrificer himself. ↑ Or Vi s varu k î, if there is any authority for this reading in Mahîdhara's commentary to the Vâ g as. Sa m hitâ XVII, 79. The Râjah of Besmah's edition has vi s varukî, which is also the reading adopted by Rammohun Roy, see Complete Works, vol. i, p. 579. ↑ The commentator takes the eighteen for the sixteen priests, the sacrificer, and his wife. But such an explanation hardly yields a satisfactory meaning, nor does plava mean perishable. ↑ Cf. Ka th . Up. II, 5. ↑ According to the commentator, this verse refers to those who know the uselessness of sacrifices and have attained to a knowledge of the qualified Brahman. They live in the forest as Vânaprasthas and Sa m nyâsins, practising tapas, i.e. whatever is proper for their state, and s raddhâ, i.e. a knowledge of Hira n yagarbha. The wise are the learned G ri hasthas, while those who live on alms are those who have forsaken their family. ↑ That person is Hira n yagarbha. His immortality is relative only, it lasts no longer than the world (sa m sâra). ↑ Cf. B ri h. Âr. II, 1, 20. ↑ The high Imperishable is here the creative, the higher the non-creative Brahman. ↑ Called Vish n u and Virâ g by the commentators. ↑ There are five fires, those of heaven, rain, earth, man, and woman. Comm. ↑ Cf. Ka th . Up. VI, 15. ↑ Ka th . Up. V, 15. ↑ S vet. Up. VI, 14; Bhag. Gîtâ IX, 15, 6. ↑ Cf. Rv. 1, 164, 20; Nir. XIV, 30; S vet. Up. IV, 6; Ka th . Up. Ill, 1. ↑ Cf. S vet. Up. IV, 7. ↑ The commentator states that, besides âtmarati h kriyâvân, there was another reading, viz. âtmaratikriyâvân. This probably owed its origin to a difficulty felt in reconciling kriyâvân, performing acts, with the brahmavidâ m varish th a h , the best of those who know Brahman, works being utterly incompatible with a true knowledge of Brahman. Kriyâvân, however, as S ankara points out, may mean here simply, having performed meditation and other acts conducive to a knowledge of Brahman. Probably truthfulness, penance, &c, mentioned in the next following verse, are the kriyâs or works intended. For grammatical reasons also this reading is preferable. But the last foot esha brahmavidâ m varish th a h is clearly defective. If we examine the commentary, we see that S ankara read brahmanish th a h , and that he did not read esha, which would give us the correct metre, brahmanish th o brahmavidâ m varish th a h . ↑ Cf. Ka th . Up. VI, 12. ↑ Cf. B ri h. Âr. I, 4, 15. ↑ All this is said by the commentator to refer to a knowledge of the conditioned Brahman only. ↑ See verse 4. ↑ The commentator refers purusha to the knower of the Self. ↑ Ka th . Up. II, 23. ↑ Cf. Taitt. Âr. X, 12, 3; S vet. Up. VI, 22; Kaiv. Up. 3; see Weber, Ind. Stud. I, p. 288. ↑ By the Yoga system, which, through restraint (yoga), leads a man to true knowledge. ↑ Cf.

The Âhavanîya fire, placed in the East, and used for sacrifices to the gods. Now the Âpana is identified with the Gârhapatya fire, no reason being given except afterwards, when it is said that the Prâ n a is the Âhavanîya fire, being taken out of the Gârhapatya, here called pra n ayana, in the same manner as the prâ n a proceeds in sleep from the apâna.
