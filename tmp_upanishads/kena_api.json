What is meant by the ear is very fully explained by the commentator, but the simplest acceptation would seem to take it as an answer to the preceding questions, so that the ear of the ear should be taken for him who directs the ear, i.e. the Self, or Brahman.

There is considerable variety in the text, as handed down in the S\u00e2ma-veda and in the Atharva-veda, which shows that it has been tampered with.

But, on the other hand, we do not know that we know him not, i.e. no one can assert that we know him not, for we want \nBrahman in order to know anything. He, therefore, who knows this double peculiarity of the knowledge of Brahman, he knows Brahman, as much as it can be known; and he does not know, nor can anybody prove it to him, that he does not know Brahman.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-6\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-6\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">\nThis kha<i>nd</i>a is generally represented as a later addition, but its prose style has more of a Br\u00e2hma<i>n</i>a character than the verses in the preceding kha<i>nd</i>as, although their metrical structure is irregular, and may be taken as a sign of antiquity.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-7\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-7\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Um\u00e2 may here be taken as the wife of <i>S</i>iva, daughter of Himavat, better known by her earlier name, P\u00e2rvat\u00ee, the daughter of the mountains. Originally she was, not the daughter of the mountains or of the Him\u00e2laya, but the daughter of the cloud, just as Rudra was originally, not the lord of the mountains, gir\u00ee<i>s</i>a, but the lord of the clouds. We are, however, moving here in a secondary period of Indian thought, in which we see, as among Semitic nations, the manifested powers, and particularly the knowledge and wisdom of the gods, represented by their wives. Um\u00e2 means originally flax, from v\u00e2, to weave, and the same word may have been an old name of wife, she who weaves (cf. duhit<i>ri</i>, spinster, and possibly wife itself, if O.H.G. w\u00eeb is connected with O.H.G. w\u00ebban). It is used almost synonymously with ambik\u00e2, Taitt. \u00c2r. p. 839. If we wished to take liberties, we might translate um\u00e2 haimavat\u00e2 by an old woman coming from the Himavat mountains; but I decline all responsibility for such an interpretation.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-8\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-8\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">The next phrase was borrowed from \u00a73, without even changing the singular to the plural. As Indra only found out that it was Brahman, the original distinction between Indra and the other gods, who only came near to it, was quite justified. Still it might be better to adopt the var. lect. sa hy etat in \u00a72.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-9\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-9\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">I have translated these paragraphs very differently from <i>S</i>a\u1e45kara and other interpreters. The wording is extremely brief, and we can only guess the original intention of the Upanishad by a reference to other passages. Now the first teaching of Brahman, by means of a comparison with the gods or heavenly things in general, seems to be that Brahman is what shines forth suddenly like lightning. Sometimes the relation between the phenomenal world and Brahman is illustrated by the relation between bubbles and the sea, or lightning and the unseen heavenly light (Mait. Up. VI, 35). In another passage, <i>Kh</i>. Up. VIII, 12, 2, lightning, when no longer seen, is to facilitate the conception of the reality of things, as distinct from their perceptibility. I think, therefore, that the first simile, taken from the phenomenal world, was meant to show that Brahman is that which appears for a moment in the lightning, and then vanishes from our sight.<br />\nThe next illustration is purely psychological. Brahman is proved to exist, because our mind moves towards things, because there is something in us which moves and perceives, and because there is something in us which holds our perceptions together (sa\u1e45kalpa), and revives them again by memory.<br />\nI give my translation as hypothetical only, for certainty is extremely difficult to attain, when we have to deal with these enigmatical sayings which, when they were first delivered, were necessarily accompanied by oral explanations.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-10\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-10\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Tadvana, as a name of Brahman, is explained by 'the desire of it,' and derived from <span style=\"letter-spacing:0.15em;\">va</span>n, to desire, the same as v\u00e2\u00f1<i>kh</i>.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-11\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-11\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">It is impossible to adopt <i>S</i>a\u1e45kara's first rendering, 'the Vedas and all the A\u1e45gas,' i.e. the six subsidiary doctrines.
