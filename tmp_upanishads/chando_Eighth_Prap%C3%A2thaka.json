The highest point that can be reached by speculation had been reached in the seventh Prap\u00e2<i>th</i>aka, the identity  of our self and of everything else with the Highest Self. This speculative effort, however, is too much for ordinary people. They cannot conceive the Sat or Brahman as out of space and time, as free from all qualities, and in order to help them, they are taught to adore the Brahman, as it appears in space and time, an object endowed with certain qualities, living in nature and in the human heart. The Highest Brahman, besides which there is nothing, and which can neither be reached as an object, nor be considered as an effect, seems to ordinary minds like a thing which is not. Therefore while the trite philosopher, after acquiring the knowledge of the Highest Sat, becomes identified with it suddenly, like lightning, the ordinary mortal must reach it by slow degrees, and as a preparation for that higher knowledge which is to follow, the eighth Prap\u00e2<i>th</i>aka, particularly the first portion of it, has been added to the teaching contained in the earlier books.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-2\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-2\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">The ether in the heart is really a name of Brahman.

But instead of showing that such abstinence is indispensable for a proper concentration of our intellectual faculties, we are told that abstinence is the same as certain sacrifices; and this is shown, not by arguments, but by a number of very far-fetched plays on words. These it is impossible to render in any translation, nay, they hardly deserve being translated. Thus abstinence is said to be identical with sacrifice, ya<i>g</i>\u00f1a, because yo g\u00f1\u00e2t\u00e2, 'he who knows,' has a certain similarity with ya<i>g</i>\u00f1a.

But when once we awake from our waking by true knowledge, we see that nothing is true but the Sat.

Sankara explains vi<i>kkh</i>\u00e2dayanti by vidr\u00e2vayanti, and this shows that he too must have read vi<i>kkh</i>\u00e2yayanti, for he could not have explained vi<i>kkh</i>\u00e2dayanti, which means they uncover or they deprive of their clothing, by vidr\u00e2vayanti, they drive away. It is true that vi<i>kkh</i>\u00e2yayanti may be explained in two ways; it may be the causative of <i>kh</i>\u00e2, to cut, but this meaning is not very appropriate here, and quite inadmissible in another passage where vi<i>kkh</i>\u00e2yayati occurs, whereas, if derived from vi<i>k</i>h (<style data-mw-deduplicate=\"TemplateStyles:r13213921\">.mw-parser-output .wst-lang-grc{font-family:GentiumPlus;font-feature-settings:\"cv78\"on,\"cv83\"on}</style><span class=\"wst-lang wst-lang-grc\" lang=\"grc\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%BF%E1%BC%B4%CF%87%CE%BF%CE%BC%CE%B1%CE%B9#Ancient_Greek\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikt:\u03bf\u1f34\u03c7\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9\">\u03bf\u1f34\u03c7\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9</a></span>) in a causative sense, <i>S</i>a\u1e45kara could hardly have chosen a better explanation that vidr\u00e2-vayanti, they make run away.

IV, 3, 20. Here also the author speaks of a man who imagines that people kill him or do him violence, or that an elephant chases him or that he falls into a pit. Here we have hast\u00eeva vi<i>kkh</i>\u00e2payati, and <i>S</i>a\u1e45kara, at least as printed by Dr. Roer, explains this by vi<i>kkh</i>\u00e2payati, vi<i>kkh</i>\u00e2dayati, vidr\u00e2vayati; dh\u00e2vat\u00eety artha<i>h</i>. Much better is Dvivedaganga's commentary, as published by Dr. Weber, <i>S</i>atap.

The passage may be interpolated, or put in on purpose to show that the Self enjoys such pleasures as an inward spectator only, without identifying himself with either pleasure or pain. He sees them, as he says afterwards, with his divine eye. The Self  perceives in all things his Self only, nothing else.
