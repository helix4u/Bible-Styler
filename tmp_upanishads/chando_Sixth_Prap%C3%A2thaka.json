How is it that living beings, when in sleep or death they are merged again in the Sat, are not destroyed?</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-24\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-24\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">The commentator remarks that according to the Veda, trees are conscious, while Buddhists and followers of Ka<i>n</i>\u00e2da hold them to be unconscious. They live, because one sees how their sap runs and how it dries up, just as one sees the sap in a living body, which, as we saw, was produced by food and water. Therefore the simile holds good. The life, or, more correctly, the liver, the living Self, pervades the tree, as it pervades man, when it has entered the organism which produces breath, mind, and speech. If any accident happens to a branch, the living Self draws himself away from that branch, and then the branch withers. The sap which caused the living Self to remain, goes, and the living Self goes away with it. The same applies to the whole tree. The tree dies when the living Self leaves it, but the living Self does not die; it only leaves an abode which it had before occupied. Some other illustrations, to show that the living Self remains, are added by the commentator: First, with regard to the living Self being the same when it awakes from deep sleep (sushupti), he remarks that we remember quite well that we have left something unfinished before we fell asleep. And then with regard to the living Self being the same when it awakes from death to a new life, he shows that creatures, as soon as they are born take the breast, and exhibit terror, which can only be explained, as he supposes, by their possessing a recollection of a former state of existence.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-25\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-25\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">The question which the son is supposed to have asked is: How can this universe which has the form and name of earth &amp;c. be produced from the Sat which is subtile, and has neither form nor name?</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-26\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-26\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">The question here is supposed to have been: If the Sat is the root of all that exists, why is it not perceived?</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-27\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-27\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Read abhipr\u00e2sya, which is evidently intended by the commentary: abhipr\u00e2yasya paritya<i>g</i>ya.

He explains the last simile as follows: A man was carried away by robbers from his own country. After his eyes had been covered, he was taken to a forest full of terrors and dangers arising from tigers, robbers, &amp;c. Not knowing where he was, and suffering from hunger and thirst, he began to cry, wishing to be delivered from his bonds. Then a man took pity on him and removed his bonds, and when he had returned to his home, he was happy. Next follows the application. Our real home is the True (Sat), the Self of the world. The forest into which we are driven is the body, made of the three elements, fire, water, earth, consisting of blood, flesh, bones, &amp;c, and liable to cold, heat, and many other evils. The bands with which our eyes are covered are our desires for many things, real or unreal, such as wife, children, cattle, &amp;c, while the robbers by whom we are driven into the forest are our good and evil deeds. Then we cry and say: 'I am the son of so and so, these are my relatives, I am happy, I am miserable, I am foolish, I am wise, I am just, I am born, I am dead, I am old, I am wretched, my son is dead, my fortune is gone, I am undone, how shall I live, where shall I go, who will save me?' These and hundreds and thousands of other evils are the bands which blind us. Then, owing to some supererogatory good works we may have done, we suddenly meet a man who knows the Self of Brahman, whose own bonds have been broken, who takes pity on us and shows us the way to see the evil which attaches to all that we love in this world. We then withdraw ourselves from all worldly pleasures. We learn that we are not mere creatures of the world, the son of so and so, &amp;c, but that we are that which is the True (Sat). The bands of our ignorance and blindness are removed, and, like the man of Gand\u00e2dra, we arrive at our own home, the Self, or the True. Then we are happy and blessed.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-31\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-31\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">The last words are really\u2014'for him there is only delay so long as I shall not be delivered; then I shall be perfect.' This requires some explanation. First of all, the change from the third to the first person, is best explained by assuming that at the point where all individuality vanishes, the father, as teacher, identifies himself with the person of whom he is speaking.\n<div class=\"&#95;_nop wst-nop\"></div>\n<p>The delay (the <i>k</i>ira or kshepa) of which he speaks is the time which passes between the attainment of true knowledge and death, or freedom from the effects of actions performed before the attainment of knowledge. The actions which led to our present embodiment must be altogether consumed, before the body can perish, and then only are we free. As to any actions performed after the attainment of knowledge, they do not count; otherwise there would be a new embodiment, and the attainment of even true knowledge would never lead to final deliverance.\n</p>\n</span></li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-p107-32\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-p107_32-0\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">The question supposed to be asked is: By what degrees a man, who has been properly instructed in the knowledge of Brahman, obtains the Sat, or returns to the True. To judge from the text both he who knows the True and he who does not, reach, when they die, the Sat, passing from speech to mind and breath and heat (fire). But whereas he who knows, remains in the Sat, they who do not know, return again to a new form of existence. It is important to observe that the commentator denies that he who knows, passes at his death through the artery of the head to the sun, and then to the Sat. He holds that with him who knows there is no further cause for delay, and that as soon as he dies, he returns to the Sat.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-33\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-33\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">The next question is: Why does he who knows, on obtaining the Sat, not return, while he who does not know, though obtaining the Sat in death, returns? An illustration is chosen which is intended to show how knowledge produces a material effect. The belief in the efficacy of ordeals must have existed at the time, and appealing to that belief, the teacher says that the man who knows himself guilty, is really burnt by the heated iron, while the man who knows himself innocent, is not. In the same manner the man who knows his Self to be the true Self, on approaching after death the true Self, is not repelled and sent back into a new existence, while he who does not know, is sent back into a new round of births and deaths. The man who tells a falsehood about himself, loses his true Self and is burnt; the man who has a false conception about his Self, loses likewise his true Self, and not knowing the true Self, even though approaching it in death, he has to suffer till he acquires some day the true knowledge.</span>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n</div>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw\u2010web.eqiad.main\u201069794d664f\u2010npr96\nCached time: 20250914210525\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [vary\u2010page\u2010id]\nCPU time usage: 0.446 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.583 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 3296/1000000\nRevision size: 1060/2097152 bytes\nPost\u2010expand include size: 66236/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 26660/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 15/100\nExpensive parser function count: 2/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 1/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 71468/5000000 bytes\nLua time usage: 0.119/10.000 seconds\nLua memory usage: 2352681/52428800 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/500\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%  552.493      1 -total\n 30.37%  167.781     18 Template:Center\n 16.24%   89.727      1 Template:Header\n 16.22%   89.604      1 Template:AuxTOC\n 15.24%   84.175     18 Template:Font-size-base\n 13.72%   75.804     17 Template:Larger\n  8.96%   49.515     18 Template:Anchor+\n  8.43%   46.591     41 Template:Optional_style\n  8.15%   45.047      1 Template:Flatlist\n  7.97%   44.018     16 Template:Sc\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwikisource:pcache:4691997:|#|:idhash:canonical and timestamp 20250914210525 and revision id 14724224.
