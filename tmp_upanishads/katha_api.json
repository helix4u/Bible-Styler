And Na<i>k</i>iketas repeated all as it had been told to him. Then M<i>ri</i>tyu, being pleased with him, said again:<br />\n<br />\n16. The generous<sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\"><span class=\"cite-bracket\">&#91;</span>12<span class=\"cite-bracket\">&#93;</span></a></sup>, being satisfied, said to him: \"I give thee now another boon; that fire-sacrifice shall be named after thee, take also this many-coloured chain<sup id=\"cite_ref-13\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\"><span class=\"cite-bracket\">&#91;</span>13<span class=\"cite-bracket\">&#93;</span></a></sup>.<br />\n<br />\n17. He who has three times performed this N\u00e2<i>k</i>iketa-rite and has been united with the three (father, mother, and teacher), and has performed the three duties (study, sacrifice, almsgiving) overcomes birth and death. When he has learnt and understood this fire, which knows (or makes us know) all that is born of Brahman<sup id=\"cite_ref-14\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-14\"><span class=\"cite-bracket\">&#91;</span>14<span class=\"cite-bracket\">&#93;</span></a></sup>, which is venerable and divine, then he obtains everlasting peace.<br />\n<br />\n18. He who knows the three N\u00e2<i>k</i>iketa fires, and knowing the three, piles up the N\u00e2<i>k</i>iketa sacrifice, he, having first, thrown off the chains of death, rejoices in the world of heaven, beyond the reach of grief.<br />\n<br />\n19. This, O Na<i>k</i>iketa, is thy fire which leads to heaven, and which thou hast chosen as thy second boon.

This I should like to know, taught by thee; this is the third of my boons.\"<br />\n<br />\n21.

Na<i>k</i>iketas said: \"On this point even the gods have doubted indeed, and thou, Death, hast declared it to be not easy to understand, and another teacher like thee is not to be found: \u2014 surely no other boon is like unto this.\"<br />\n<br />\n23. Death said: \"Choose sons and grandsons who shall live a hundred years, herds of cattle, elephants, gold, and horses. Choose the wide abode of the earth, and live thyself as many harvests as thou desirest.<br />\n<br />\n24. If you can think of any boon equal to that, choose wealth, and long life.

Na<i>k</i>iketas said: \"These things last till tomorrow, O Death, for they wear out this vigour of all the senses. Even the whole of life is short.

What mortal, slowly decaying here below, and knowing, after having approached them, the freedom from decay enjoyed by the immortals, would delight in a long life, after he has pondered on the pleasures which arise from beauty and love<sup id=\"cite_ref-17\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-17\"><span class=\"cite-bracket\">&#91;</span>17<span class=\"cite-bracket\">&#93;</span></a></sup>?<br />\n<br />\n29.

Death said: \"The good is one thing, the pleasant another; these two, having different objects, chain a man. It is well with him who clings to the good; he who chooses the pleasant, misses his end.<br />\n<br />\n2. The good and the pleasant approach man: the wise goes round about them and distinguishes them. Yea, the wise prefers the good to the pleasant, but the fool chooses the pleasant through greed and avarice.<br />\n<br />\n3.

The Hereafter never rises before the eyes of the careless child, deluded by the delusion of wealth. \"This is the world,\" he thinks, \"there is no other;\" \u2014 thus he falls again and again under my sway.<br />\n<br />\n7.

Yet though I am such a good pupil, my father has said that he will consign me unto death. What duty has he to fulfil toward Yama which he means to fulfil to-day by giving me to him? There may be no duty, he may only have spoken in haste. Yet a father's word must not be broken.\" Having considered this, the son comforted his father, and exhorted him to behave like his forefathers, and to keep his word. I do not think this view of <i>S</i>ankara's could have been the view of the old poet. He might have made the son say that he was the best or one of the best of his father's pupils, but hardly that he was also one of his middling pupils, thus implying that he never was among the worst. That would be out of keeping with the character of Na<i>k</i>iketas, as drawn by the poet himself. Na<i>k</i>iketas is full of faith and wishes to die, he would be the last to think of excuses why he should not die. The second half of the verse may be more doubtful. It may mean what <i>S</i>ankara thinks it means, only that we should get thus again an implied complaint of Na<i>k</i>iketas against his father, and this is not in keeping with his character. The mind of Na<i>k</i>iketas is bent on what is to come, on what he will see after death, and on what Yama will do unto him. \"What has Yama to do,\" he asks, \"what can he do, what is it that he will to-day do unto me?\" This seems to me consistent with the - ancient story, while <i>S</i>ankara's interpretations and interpolations savour too much of the middle ages of India.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-6\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-6\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Sasya, corn rather than grass; -, -, Benfey; Welsh haidd, according to Rhys; different from <i>s</i>ash-pa, ces-pes, Benfey.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-7\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-7\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Cf.
